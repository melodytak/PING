# PING
Pyramidal Interneuronal Network Gamma

Code for a basic PING network with 250 neurons (200 E-cells, 50 I-cells).

Outputs a rastergram depicting when each neuron spiked within a given time interval, as well as the mean voltage of the excitatory cells over time. 

Settings are such that a network gamma rhythm of ~50Hz should result.

Run the make_figure file to generate the figure (image is also saved as a pdf file).
